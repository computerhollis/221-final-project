In response to Chris' feedback on our original proposal, we have modified our research proposal to investigate key characteristics of Million Dollar Hoods to understand these neighborhoods and the existing conditions that relate to the high amount of extraction of people and resources. 

Based on data investigation from our team, we will focus on three key variables to look at: Education, Socio-Economic Status,and Environment. We will visualize demographic characteristics to describe the neighborhoods we are speaking of. 
We will use the follosing data sources:

Education: Census ACS Education Demographic [data](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP1Y2023.DP02?q=Education)   
Socio-Economic Status: Census [data](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2023.S0501?q=S0501:%20Selected%20Characteristics%20of%20the%20Native%20and%20Foreign-Born%20Populations)  
Environment: FEMA's National Risk Index [map](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/) and EPA's EJ Screening [tool](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data)

**Team roles:**

Hollis: team repo holder, socio-economic status  
Amil: narrative building for the Jupyter notebook, education  
Leila: slide presentation, environment  

**Status Update:**

We are grateful for the feedback from Chris to limit to a single dependant variable of the million dollar hood data, and will be looking at the three other indicators for extraction based on the indepedant variables listed above. The team is a little concerned with the steep learning curve for learning the python coding but are generally feeling good about making the necessary charts and maps for the midterm.

**Concerns**

We are mainly concerned with putting together a cohesive narrative around the data we are collecting. We want to develop a broader story about Million Dollar Hoods as sites of extraction of both resources and people, and we want to use the other data sources as opportunities to describe these neighborhoods better. With these categories selected, we are still trying to figure out how they fit together.
