#Mapping Extraction: The Spatial Relationship Between Jails and Data Centers In Los Angeles

**By: Amil Hogan, Leila Ullmann, Hollis Wyatt**

Our group project centrally asks what is the spatial relationship between jails and data centers as sites of extraction in Los Angeles County? 

We are interested in examining the relationship between these two major sites and sources of extraction in Los Angeles for a few reasons. Jails in Los Angeles, among many other functions, serve to extract people from their communities and resources that must go to and remain in these communities. According to Million Dollar Hoods, a UCLA critical mapping project, at a cost of nearly $1 billion annually, more than 27,000 people are caged every night in L.A.’s county jails and city lockups. But not every neighborhood is equally impacted by L.A.’s massive jail system. In fact, L.A.’s nearly billion-dollar jail budget is largely committed to incarcerating many people from just a few neighborhoods. We are interested in examining extraction from these communities at the hands of local mass incarceration. Additionally, according to datacenters.com, there are 105 data centers in Los Angeles County. Data Centers are increasingly becoming the subject of inquiry as they are being built across the county to meet the exponentially increasing demand for data, and thus, data storage. This project understands data centers as an additional site of extraction, both as the site of data that is extracted from users across the world, but also as geographic sites with demands for power, water, and other resources. A December 2024 Bloomberg article entitled “AI Needs so Much Power, It’s Making Your’s Worse,” indicates that the presence of a data center in a community distorts the normal flow of electricity for the surrounding neighborhood. The article analyzed energy data and found that more than three-quarters of highly-distorted power readings across the country are within 50 miles of significant data center activity. We are interested in mapping the relationship between jails and data centers in LA County as a way of identifying who suffers the worst impacts of these kinds of extraction.

We are focusing on the geographic bounds primarily because the team is all currently residing in Los Angeles, and we feel it is important to situate our work with where we are– both to engage critically with where we live, and also to attempt, in a small way, to support the production of knowledge and understanding in the place that we are living in. Additionally, according to Million Dollar Hoods, Los Angeles County operates the largest jail system in the United States, which imprisons more people than any other nation on Earth. 

One of the data sources we intend to use is a map of the 105 data centers in Los Angeles, identified here: https://www.datacenters.com/locations/united-states/california/los-angeles. This will give us an indication of which neighborhoods are more susceptible to power distortion as a result of the presence of the data center. We also hope to locate data that tracks power disruptions in Los Angeles county, and hope to locate other data that might indicate the impacts of data centers in the surrounding community.

Another dataset we plan to use is from the organization Million Dollar Hoods (MDH) based at UCLA(https://equity-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/lacounty::incarceration-impact-neighborhood/about). The MDH project focuses on mapping the impact of incarceration within Los Angeles, providing data on LAPD and LASD arrests, jail durations, and the fiscal costs associated with incarceration. It normalizes this data using population estimates and includes spatial attributes such as supervisory districts and service planning areas. This dataset is essential for understanding the geographic distribution of incarceration costs and the social equity implications of incarceration within Los Angeles.

The central focus of our project is to analyze the spatial relationship between jails and data centers in Los Angeles County as sites of extraction, with the goal of discovering trends related to disparities in their impacts on surrounding communities. Using GIS mapping and spatial analysis tools, we will examine the geographic proximity of these sites to neighborhoods and explore the overlapping impacts they may have on vulnerable populations.
 
Specifically, we aim to visualize the following: 
1. Geographic Distribution of Jails and Data Centers: Identify spatial clusters and patterns.

2. Impacts of Data Centers: Create maps and graphs showing neighborhoods near data centers, overlaid with data on power distortions or other environmental effects caused by these facilities. 

3. Incarceration Impact: Visualize incarceration rates and fiscal costs of jails by neighborhood. 

4. Combined Impact Zones:Identify neighborhoods where both jails and data centers are present or nearby, analyzing the compounded extraction impacts on these communities.

This research aims to provide critical insights into how systems of extraction, particularly through mass incarceration and data storage, are geographically linked and disproportionately affect certain neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. By mapping this relationship, we hope to identify key areas where the impacts of incarceration and the resource demands of data centers overlap. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these systems perpetuate inequalities, particularly in communities that are heavily overpoliced. Additionally, this project seeks to raise awareness of the environmental and infrastructural strains caused by data centers, highlighting how resources extracted from local neighborhoods can exacerbate existing social vulnerabilities. Ultimately, we hope our analysis will contribute to efforts to promote policy changes that reduce extractive practices within Los Angeles County and connect local conditions to broader patterns of social inequality.
