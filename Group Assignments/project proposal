# Mapping Extraction: The Spatial Relationship Between Jails and Data Centers In Los Angeles

**By: Amil Hogan, Leila Ullmann, Hollis Wyatt**

Our group project centrally asks: *What is the spatial relationship between jails and data centers as sites of extraction in Los Angeles County?*

We aim to visualize the following:
1. **Geographic Distribution of Jails and Data Centers**: Identify spatial clusters and patterns.
2. **Impacts of Data Centers**: Maps and graphs of neighborhoods near data centers, overlaying power distortions.
3. **Incarceration Impact**: Visualize incarceration rates and fiscal costs by neighborhood.
